==================== ========================================================


* Callback functions

Callback functions STATUS, ERROR, COMPLETE and `cdr\\='s in element of
the alist STATUS-CODE take same keyword arguments listed below.  For
forward compatibility, these functions must ignore unused keyword
arguments (i.e., it\\='s better to use `&allow-other-keys\\=' [#]_).::

    (CALLBACK                      ; SUCCESS/ERROR/COMPLETE/STATUS-CODE
     :data          data           ; whatever PARSER function returns, or nil
     :error-thrown  error-thrown   ; (ERROR-SYMBOL . DATA), or nil
     :symbol-status symbol-status  ; success/error/timeout/abort/parse-error
     :response      response       ; request-response object
     ...)

.. [#] `&allow-other-keys\\=' is a special \"markers\" available in macros
   in the CL library for function definition such as `cl-defun\\=' and
   `cl-function\\='.  Without this marker, you need to specify all arguments
   to be passed.  This becomes problem when request.el adds new arguments
   when calling callback functions.  If you use `&allow-other-keys\\='
   (or manually ignore other arguments), your code is free from this
   problem.  See info node `(cl) Argument Lists\\=' for more information.

Arguments data, error-thrown, symbol-status can be accessed by
`request-response-data\\=', `request-response-error-thrown\\=',
`request-response-symbol-status\\=' accessors, i.e.::

    (request-response-data RESPONSE)  ; same as data

Response object holds other information which can be accessed by
the following accessors:
`request-response-status-code\\=',
`request-response-url\\=' and
`request-response-settings\\='

* STATUS-CODE callback

STATUS-CODE is an alist of the following format::

    ((N-1 . CALLBACK-1)
     (N-2 . CALLBACK-2)
     ...)

Here, N-1, N-2,... are integer status codes such as 200.


* FILES

FILES is an alist of the following format::

    ((NAME-1 . FILE-1)
     (NAME-2 . FILE-2)
     ...)

where FILE-N is a list of the form::

    (FILENAME &key PATH BUFFER STRING MIME-TYPE)

FILE-N can also be a string (path to the file) or a buffer object.
In that case, FILENAME is set to the file name or buffer name.

Example FILES argument::

    `((\"passwd\"   . \"/etc/passwd\")                ; filename = passwd
      (\"scratch\"  . ,(get-buffer \"*scratch*\"))    ; filename = *scratch*
      (\"passwd2\"  . (\"password.txt\" :file \"/etc/passwd\"))
      (\"scratch2\" . (\"scratch.txt\"  :buffer ,(get-buffer \"*scratch*\")))
      (\"data\"     . (\"data.csv\"     :data \"1,2,3\\n4,5,6\\n\")))

.. note:: FILES is implemented only for curl backend for now.
   As furl.el_ supports multipart POST, it should be possible to
   support FILES in pure elisp by making furl.el_ another backend.
   Contributions are welcome.

   .. _furl.el: https://code.google.com/p/furl-el/


* PARSER function

PARSER function takes no argument and it is executed in the
buffer with HTTP response body.  The current position in the HTTP
response buffer is at the beginning of the buffer.  As the HTTP
header is stripped off, the cursor is actually at the beginning
of the response body.  So, for example, you can pass `json-read\\='
to parse JSON object in the buffer.  To fetch whole response as a
string, pass `buffer-string\\='.

When using `json-read\\=', it is useful to know that the returned
type can be modified by `json-object-type\\=', `json-array-type\\=',
`json-key-type\\=', `json-false\\=' and `json-null\\='.  See docstring of
each function for what it does.  For example, to convert JSON
objects to plist instead of alist, wrap `json-read\\=' by `lambda\\='
like this.::

    (request
     \"https://...\"
     :parser (lambda ()
               (let ((json-object-type \\='plist))
                 (json-read)))
     ...)

This is analogous to the `dataType\\=' argument of jQuery.ajax_.
Only this function can access to the process buffer, which
is killed immediately after the execution of this function.

* SYNC

Synchronous request is functional, but *please* don\\='t use it
other than testing or debugging.  Emacs users have better things
to do rather than waiting for HTTP request.  If you want a better
way to write callback chains, use `request-deferred\\='.

If you can\\='t avoid using it (e.g., you are inside of some hook
which must return some value), make sure to set TIMEOUT to
relatively small value.

Due to limitation of `url-retrieve-synchronously\\=', response slots
`request-response-error-thrown\\=', `request-response-history\\=' and
`request-response-url\\=' are unknown (always nil) when using
synchronous request with `url-retrieve\\=' backend.

* Note

API of `request\\=' is somewhat mixture of jQuery.ajax_ (Javascript)
and requests.request_ (Python).

Which set of key bindings to add to the global keymap, if any.

This option controls which set of Magit key bindings, if any, may
be added to the global keymap, even before Magit is first used in
the current Emacs session.

If the value is nil, no bindings are added.

If `default', maybe add:

    C-x g     `magit-status'
    C-x M-g   `magit-dispatch'
    C-c M-g   `magit-file-dispatch'

    C-c g     `magit-dispatch'
    C-c f     `magit-file-dispatch'

    These bindings are strongly recommended, but we cannot use
    them by default, because the \"C-c <LETTER>\" namespace is
    strictly reserved for bindings added by the user.

The bindings in the chosen set may be added when
`after-init-hook' is run.  Each binding is added if, and only
if, at that time no other key is bound to the same command,
and no other command is bound to the same key.  In other words
we try to avoid adding bindings that are unnecessary, as well
as bindings that conflict with other bindings.

Adding these bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook' is
run to allow users to set the variable anywhere in their init
file (without having to make sure to do so before `magit' is
loaded or autoloaded) and to increase the likelihood that all
the potentially conflicting user bindings have already been
added.

To set this variable use either `setq' or the Custom interface.
Do not use the function `customize-set-variable' because doing
that would cause Magit to be loaded immediately, when that form
is evaluated (this differs from `custom-set-variables', which
doesn't load the libraries that define the customized variables).

No disk files are touched - the buffer doesn't even need to be

use ordinary undo to get your code back to its previous state.

You will need to install external programs to do the formatting.
If the command can't find the program that it needs, it will try
to tell you how you might be able to install it on your operating
system. Only BibTeX, Emacs Lisp and Ledger are formatted without an
external program.

A suitable formatter is selected according to the `major-mode' of
the buffer.  Many popular programming languages are supported.
It is fairly easy to add new languages that have an external
formatter.  When called interactively or PROMPT-P is non-nil, a
missing formatter is prompted in the minibuffer.

If PROMPT is non-nil (or the function is called as an interactive
command), a missing formatter is prompted in the minibuffer.  If
PROMPT is the symbol `always' (or a prefix argument is given),
the formatter is prompted for even if one has already been set.

The mode-line displays of minor modes usually begin with a space, so
the modes' names appear as separate words on the mode line.  However, if
you're having problems with a cramped mode line, you may choose to use single
letters for some modes, without leading spaces.  Capitalizing them works
best; if you then diminish some mode to \"X\" but have `abbrev-mode' enabled as

(autoload 'consult-grep "consult" "\
Search with `grep' for files in DIR where the content matches a regexp.

The initial input is given by the INITIAL argument.  DIR can be nil, a
directory string or a list of file/directory paths.  If `consult-grep'
is called interactively with a prefix argument, the user can specify the
directories or files to search in.  Multiple directories or files must
be separated by comma in the minibuffer, since they are read via
`completing-read-multiple'.  By default the project directory is used if
`consult-project-function' is defined and returns non-nil.  Otherwise
the `default-directory' is searched.  If the command is invoked with a
double prefix argument (twice `C-u') the user is asked for a project, if
not yet inside a project, or the current project is searched.

The input string is split, the first part of the string (grep input) is
passed to the asynchronous grep process and the second part of the
string is passed to the completion-style filtering.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is given as
the first character of the input string.  The format is similar to
Perl-style regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/.  Furthermore command
line options can be passed to grep, specified behind --.  The overall
prompt input has the form `#async-input -- grep-opts#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular
expressions to Posix regular expressions.  Always enter Emacs regular
expressions at the prompt.  `consult-grep' behaves like builtin Emacs
search commands, e.g., Isearch, which take Emacs regular expressions.
Furthermore the asynchronous input split into words, each word must
match separately and in any order.  See `consult--regexp-compiler' for
the inner workings.  In order to disable transformations of the grep
input, adjust `consult--regexp-compiler' accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)
#word -- -C3        : Search for word, include 3 lines as context
#first#second       : Search for first, quick filter for second.

The symbol at point is added to the future history.
